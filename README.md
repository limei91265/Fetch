Hi Fetch Hiring Manager,

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this assignment! I’ve structured my submission into three parts for clarity:

Part1: Data Exploration – Identifies key data quality issues, challenging fields, and initial insights. <br />
Part2: SQL Queries – Answers to 2 closed-ended and 1 open-ended questions, including assumptions and findings: 
  - What are top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?
  - What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?
  - Who are Fetch’s power users?  <br />

Part3: Communication with stakeholder – Includes key data quality issues, trends derived from the data and a request for action.  <br />
The code is commented, and assumptions are explicitly stated to provide transparency into my approach. Let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like me to elaborate on any part of the analysis.

Looking forward to your feedback!
Mei
